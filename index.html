  <h2> Welcome to my Weather Blog!</h2>
 
 <p>
   This of course aside from programming is a hobby of mine. But, I really didn't want to do weather for a job. So I decided to stick with a blog. </p>
  
  <p>
    You can use the menu to navigate this site. The Actual "Blog" part is on wordpress. I really don't care for it, but I am only needing it for blog posts. The rest of this site is completely by me. </p>
  
  <p>
    Next, is where I cover - well - as much as I loved to. I can't cover all over. - to be more specific you need to live in Martin, Daviess, Knox, Orange, Dubois, county Indiana. 
    The weather information will only be general information. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I will  also have my app rolling out soon. As you should have already assumed as a developer - well I wanna keep you guys informed! 
    While I can't at all hours. I will have advice on other sources of information etc.. 
  </p>
  <p>
    More stuff will be added soon!
